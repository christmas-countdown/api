# ChristmasCountdownAPI

The Christmas Countdown API.

## Documentation

Full documentation at [docs.christmascountdown.live/api](https://docs.christmascountdown.live/api).

## Authentication

Currently the public API does not require a token or other form of authentication. Please let me know if you want to use the API though.

## Rate limits

Currently you can make up to 100 requests per minute. Please contact me (via email or Discord) if this isn't enough.
Please do **not** make a request for the number of seconds left every second.

This API can't be used for a countdown website, that should be done client-side. You can use this to show the number of days/sleeps left on your normal website though.
